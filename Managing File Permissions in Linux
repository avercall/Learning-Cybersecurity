The purpose of this file is to showcase how to manage permissions within the Linux (Bash) command line. 
Removing and updating user permissions ensures that documents and files can only be accessed by those who need them. 
Following the principle of least permissions, users should only have access to content necessary to complete their tasks.


The following code shows how Linux commands can be used to determine existing permissions of a specified directory:

researcher2@0c87e4e5eade:~$ pwd
/home/researcher2
researcher2@0c87e4e5eade:~$ ls -la
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Jul 12 21:48 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root        root          4096 Jul 12 20:52 ..
-rw------- 1 researcher2 research_team   35 Jul 12 21:52 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 researcher2 research_team  220 Apr 18  2019 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 researcher2 research_team 3574 Jul 12 20:52 .bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 researcher2 research_team 3574 Jul 12 20:52 .profile
drwxr-xr-x 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Jul 12 20:52 projects


Starting with line 8, the command "pwd" shows that the user is in the reasearcher2 directory, as shown on line 9. 
The command "ls" returns files within the current directory. Adding the "-la" option returns all file (including hidden ones) and their 
permissions. 

Permissions are described as a string of 10 characters. The fist character of each string is either a "d" for directory or a 
hyphen (-) for a file. The next 9 characters can be split into sets of 3. The first 3 characters describe the permissions of the user. 
The next 3 describe the permissions of the group. The final 3 describe the permissions of others. each set of 3 characters comes in 
a "rwx" format where "r" stands for read, "w" stands for write, and "x" stands for execute. If there is a hyphen (-) instead of an "r"
"w" or "x" means that permission has been denied. 

Looking at line 12 we see that the first character is "d" meaning that this is the permissions string of a directory. The next 3 
characters that describe the authorizations of the user are "rwx" meaning that they have read, write and execute permissions. 
The second set of 3 is "r-x" meaning that the group has read and execute permissions but does not have write permissions. The final
set of 3 is also "r-x" meaning that others have read and execute permissions but cannot write. 

The following code demonstrates how we can change user permissions using the command "chmod". We will be changing the user permissions
of the ".bash_history" file (line 14 above):


researcher2@0c87e4e5eade:~$ chmod u-r,g+w .bash_history
researcher2@0c87e4e5eade:~$ ls -la
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Jul 12 21:48 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root        root          4096 Jul 12 20:52 ..
--w--w---- 1 researcher2 research_team  268 Jul 12 22:22 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 researcher2 research_team  220 Apr 18  2019 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 researcher2 research_team 3574 Jul 12 20:52 .bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 researcher2 research_team 3574 Jul 12 20:52 .profile
drwxr-xr-x 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Jul 12 20:52 projects


The command "chmod" in line 40 allows for us to edit the authorizations of a file or directory. The code "u-r" means that I 
removed read permissions from the user. The code "g+w" means that I gave write permissions to the group. If I wanted to add 
execute permissions to others I would have typed "o+x" following the "g+w" code. the ".bash_history" at the end of line 40
indicates which file's permissions I want to edit. Comparing line 45 to line 14 above we can see that the permissions have changed.
