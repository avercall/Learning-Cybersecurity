The purpose of this file is to showcase how to manage permissions within the Linux (Bash) command line. 
Removing and updating user permissions insures that documents and files can only be accessed by those who need them. 
Following the principle of least permissions, a user should only have access to content necessary to complete their tasks.


The following code shows how Linux commands can be used to determine existing permissions of a specified directory:
researcher2@0c87e4e5eade:~$ ls -la
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 3 researcher2 research_team 4096 Jul 12 21:48 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root        root          4096 Jul 12 20:52 ..
-rw------- 1 researcher2 research_team   18 Jul 12 21:48 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 researcher2 research_team  220 Apr 18  2019 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 researcher2 research_team 3574 Jul 12 20:52 .bashrc
